# AcademicCV

AcademicCV is a CV template written in [Typst](https://typst.app/), adapted (but not limited to) academic profiles. 

The template was forked from [SimpleCV](https://github.com/LaurenzV/simplecv), and is also based on [AcademicResume](https://github.com/abrandenberger/academic-resume).
